1. Population
A population refers to the entire set of individuals, items, or data points that share a common characteristic of interest in a study. It’s the complete group from which researchers seek to draw conclusions.

Examples:
• Every family residing in a specific city
• All enrolled students at a particular university
• The full workforce of a company

Scenario Application:
Population = All families living in the city

2. Sample
A sample is a subset or portion of the population selected for the purpose of study. When it’s not feasible to collect data from the whole population, a sample provides a practical way to gain insights.

Examples:
• Collecting responses from 200 students instead of the whole university
• Interviewing 1,000 residents to estimate election preferences
• Reviewing the performance of 50 out of 1,000 employees

Scenario Application:
Sample = 100 households chosen for the survey
