1. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics involve techniques for summarizing and organizing data in a meaningful way. They offer a clear snapshot of a dataset without drawing any broader conclusions.

Main Aspects of Descriptive Statistics:
• Central Tendency Measures: Average (Mean), Middle value (Median), Most frequent value (Mode)
• Spread or Dispersion Measures: Minimum and Maximum range, Variability (Variance), Data spread (Standard Deviation)
• Visual Representations: Data Tables, Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Histograms

Illustration:
If the average marks of a class are found to be 85%, it provides a simple overview of that class’s performance, without extending the insight to other classes or schools.

2. Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics deal with making predictions or generalizations about a larger population using data from a sample. It supports decision-making and hypothesis evaluation.

Core Methods in Inferential Statistics:
• Hypothesis Testing Methods: t-tests, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), Chi-Square Tests
• Confidence Estimation: Constructing confidence intervals to estimate population values
• Regression Modeling: Identifying and predicting variable relationships
• Correlation Measurement: Assessing the strength and direction of relationships between variables

Example:
From a study involving 500 individuals, it's estimated that 60% of the entire city’s population prefers online shopping. This inference is drawn from a subset (sample) to represent the whole (population).
