Sampling Techniques
Sampling involves selecting a portion of individuals from a larger population to analyze trends, opinions, or behaviors. The method chosen plays a crucial role in the quality, fairness, and reliability of the results.

1. Simple Random Sampling
In this method, every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen. Selection is completely random and not influenced by any characteristic or grouping.

Examples:
• Drawing 100 employee names randomly from the entire company database
• Using a computerized random number generator to select survey participants

Advantages:
 Reduces selection bias
Disadvantages:
 May not guarantee representation from all relevant subgroups

2. Stratified Sampling
Here, the population is divided into distinct categories or groups (called strata) based on shared characteristics like departments or job levels. A sample is then drawn proportionally from each stratum.

Examples:
• Sampling employees from each department according to its size
• Collecting input from staff based on role (e.g., junior, mid-level, senior)

Advantages:
 Ensures balanced representation from all sections of the population
Disadvantages:
 Requires prior knowledge of the population structure

3. Systematic Sampling
This technique selects participants at regular, fixed intervals from a pre-ordered list.

Examples:
• Picking every 5th name from a company roster
• Surveying every 10th visitor on a website or intranet

Advantages:
 Easy to implement and time-efficient
Disadvantages:
 Can introduce bias if the list contains a recurring pattern

4. Convenience Sampling
Participants are chosen based on ease of access or immediate availability, not through randomization or structured selection.

Examples:
• Surveying employees who are attending a particular meeting
• Gathering opinions from staff in one office wing

Advantages:
 Quick and cost-saving
Disadvantages:
 Highly prone to bias and not representative of the broader group
